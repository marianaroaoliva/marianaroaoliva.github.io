	<p>Frances Mason Harris '26
“All Science” is a great and spirited collection of stories. At once wonderfully observant, alert to the world, to the voices and languages of the world, especially the sights and sounds of Mexico, but also thrillingly smart, and animated with respect to the history and philosophy of contemporary literature. As such, throughout, the stories sing with human foibles, are funny and sad, but they also think about what language is, and how language and discourse refracts, and fails to refract, the landscapes and events around us. This is an extremely thoughtful and warm first collection of stories, by a writer of great promise.</p>
	<p>Feldman Prize in Fiction                                           
These seven stories are brief, enigmatic, beautifully written; many, though not all, are creation stories – in these pages, a growing child invents the world; a narrator builds a house containing, it seems, all possible things, including the wolf that destroys the thing the narrator loves best; history itself is revealed as the by-product of an endless primeval orgy. But here there are endings, too: in “Lighthouse,” the narrator and a friend spend “our planet’s last day of summer” together, in a world of Escher-like images: “We spent the morning in the ocean and watched the water turn to fish, the fish to pelicans, and the pelicans to sky. I saw the sun turn into Rav’s hair while I melted with the heat into the sand.” I am pleased to award the Feldman Prize for Fiction to these lyrical and mysterious stories.</p>
